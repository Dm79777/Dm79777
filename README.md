# Hi, Iâ€™m DivyaðŸ‘‹

Hey, I'm Divya, a CS student at the University of Waterloo with a keen interest in full-stack development and AI. 

Currently, I'm researching at SignSpeak alongside UW for ASL translation. Check out our [project](https://github.com/adityamakkar000/SignSpeak) here! 

Previously, I've built projects including [FireWatch](https://github.com/FireWatch-ai/fireWatch), a fire prediction pipeline.
